# Banker-Algorithm
The famous Banker Algorithm to prevent deadlock. This application run with threads the different client request. This application will run by **Edsger Dijkstra** simulation like the one in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm). As a parameter you need to pass how much resources and their quantity you want to use. For example let's use 3 resources:
- Resource A: 3
- Resource B: 5
- Resource C: 7

Then we need to input that parameter like this 

`java class 3 5 7`

That will give us **A**=*3*, **B**=*5* and **C**=*7*.

##Pre-requisites
You need to have previously installed Java:
- Java Runtime Environment (7 atleast)
- Java Development Kit 7

To start the application clone the repository or download the zip file. 

###Windows users
1. Open cmd.
2. cd to the directory where are the program files
3. Enter /src directory
